# Hello, LLM
This is a 5-day crash course project with dedicated 1-2 hours for each day whenever I could find time between my busy schedule.

To find more information about 5-day crash course newsletter, check out Brian Jenney's newsletter or register directly at https://www.parsity.io/noob

## Day 0
- Prep for crash course by:
  - Scheduling time during the week or whenever you can
  - VS code, if you are new to it

## Day 1 - HTML
- HTML syntax is quite straightforward, so nothing much to add here. 

## Day 2 - CSS
### Topics To Know:
- `id` vs `class`
  - `id`: one id for one element at a time.
  - `class`: one class can be used across multiple elements.
- margin vs padding
  - margin adds space **outside**
  - padding adds space **inside**
- cascading
  - rendering precedence to bottom most element, if element present twice.
- flexbox
  - 


### Syntax
- Syntax: 
  ```css
  selector { 
    property: value; 
  }
  ```
- `selector`: what you're styling (body, h1, .class, #id)
- `property`: what you change (color, font-family, margin, etc.)
- `value`: how you change it (cornflowerblue, 20px, etc.)

**No need to memorize every property. Learn patterns. Google + MDN = your best friend**
